# Travel Buddy

This is a symfony web app for browsing travel locations, showing their current weather and making travel plans for them. The app was done as a group project for Business College Helsinki's full stack course. The app uses pictures from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) and icons from [icons8](https://icons8.com/).
